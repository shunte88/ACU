CROSS-SIZE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

1. PERFORMANCE SCALING
-------------------------

CONCLUSIONS
===============
• Size Impact:
  - Smaller datasets (10,000 elements):
    * All algorithms perform reasonably well
    * O(n²) algorithms are still viable
  - Medium datasets (100,000-250,000 elements):
    * O(n log n) algorithms show clear advantage
    * Some O(n²) algorithms may become impractical
  - Large datasets (500,000+ elements):
    * Only efficient algorithms are practical
    * Memory usage becomes significant

• Language Performance:
  - C & C++ maintain consistent performance across sizes
  - Go shows good scaling with size
  - Java's JIT compilation becomes more effective with larger sizes
  - JavaScript's performance varies more with size
  - Python's performance gap increases with size

• Algorithm Selection Guidelines:
  - Small datasets (< 10,000): Any algorithm is suitable
  - Medium datasets (10,000-100,000): Quick Sort or Merge Sort recommended
  - Large datasets (> 100,000): Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or specialized algorithms
  - Very large datasets (> 500,000): Consider parallel implementations
