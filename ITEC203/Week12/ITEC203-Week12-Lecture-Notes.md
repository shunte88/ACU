# Structure of the course

Part 1: Data Science
- Preview the Dataframe
- Prepare the data for ML

Fundamentals of Machine Learning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Classification/Clustering/Regression

Neural Networks and Deep Learning

# Libraries used in the course
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras

# Basic concepts of Data Science

What is Data Science:
- Data Science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
- It is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to understand and analyze real-world phenomena.

Target of Data Science:
- Extracting knowledge from data
- Using data to make decisions
- Using data to make predictions

# Load Dataset
- Read csv file 
- Load datasets with Scikit-Learn
- Preview the Dataframe: head(), tail(), info(), describe(), value_counts(), unique(), hist(), corr()

Visualization with matplotlib
Visualization with seaborn

# Prepare the Data for ML
- Data Cleaning - missing data: df.isna().sum()
- Text and Categorical Attributes

# Fundamentals of Machine Learning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Classification/Clustering/Regression

- The Curse of Dimensionality

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Types of ML Systems
- Supervised Learning: training set includes **labels**
- Unsupervised Learning: training data is **un**labeled

# Machine Learning Tasks
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering

# Classification Algorithms
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN, week 6)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM, week 7)
- Decision Tree (week 7)
- Random Forest (week 7)

# Classification (SVM) Model algorithm
- Step1: setting up model: model = SVC()
- Step2: fitting the model: model.fit()
- Step3: make new predictions: model.predict()

# Regression fitting models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression

# What is a Clustering Model
- Group similar instances together into clusters
- Vast majority of data is unlabelled

# Clustering Algorithms
- K-means
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Gaussian Mixture

# Neural Networks and Deep Learning (week 10, week 11)

## What is a Neural Network
- An input layer
- One more than one hidden layers
- An output layer

## Training a Neural Network Model

compile(), fit(), then predict()

# Tensorflow and Keras

- TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models, which can run on top of TensorFlow.
- TensorFlow provides the backend for Keras, allowing users to build and train deep learning models with ease and running on top of TensorFlow

# Plans for the next 2 months

- https://www.kaggle.com/learn

- Follow the course [MIT Introduction to Deep Learning | 6.S191](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) & [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI). Pros: Newer contents & engaging sample code. Recommeneded for those who want to an overview about deep learning in short time.

- Alternatively, read the part II of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" & practice the code ([github](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3)).Cons: Old contents, requires a lot of time to read and practice the code. Recommended for those who want to take a deep dive into deep learning seriously.

To practice with the code
- Practice with [Keras examples](https://keras.io/examples/)
- Practice with [TensorFlow examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- (Optional) Learn [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) if you want to work with vision
- Learn [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Python framework for data-driven web apps, dashboards, and ML prototypes
