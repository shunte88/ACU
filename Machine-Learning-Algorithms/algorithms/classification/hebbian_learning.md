# Hebbian Learning

## Overview
Hebbian Learning is one of the fundamental learning rules in neural networks, based on the principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together." It's a form of unsupervised learning that strengthens connections between neurons that are simultaneously active.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Hebb's Rule**: Basic principle of synaptic plasticity
2. **Weight Updates**: Based on correlation between input and output
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: No explicit error signal
4. **Local Learning**: Updates depend only on local information

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize network weights
2. For each training example:
   - Compute output activation
   - Update weights based on input-output correlation
3. Repeat until convergence
4. Make predictions using learned weights

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Basic Hebbian Rule
For input x and output y:
```
Δw = η * x * y
```
where:
- Δw is weight change
- η is learning rate
- x is input
- y is output

#### Normalized Hebbian Rule
```
Δw = η * (x * y - w * y²)
```

## Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Biologically plausible
- Unsupervised learning
- Local learning rule
- Fast computation

## Limitations
- No error correction
- May lead to unbounded growth
- Requires normalization
- Limited to linear problems
- No guarantee of convergence

## Time Complexity
- Training: O(n * p * i) where:
  - n is samples
  - p is features
  - i is iterations
- Prediction: O(p)

## Space Complexity
- O(p * k) for weights
where k is number of classes

## Use Cases
- Feature learning
- Pattern recognition
- Dimensionality reduction
- Associative memory
- Neural modeling

## Best Practices
1. Normalize inputs
2. Use appropriate learning rate
3. Apply weight decay
4. Monitor weight growth
5. Regularize if needed
