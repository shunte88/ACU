# Gradient Descent

## Overview
Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in training neural networks. It minimizes the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent, as defined by the negative of the gradient. This implementation includes mini-batch processing and momentum for improved convergence.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Gradient Calculation**: Computing partial derivatives
2. **Weight Updates**: Moving in negative gradient direction
3. **Mini-batch Processing**: Processing data in small batches
4. **Momentum**: Adding velocity to updates for better convergence

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize network weights and biases
2. For each epoch:
   - Shuffle training data
   - For each mini-batch:
     - Forward pass
     - Compute gradients
     - Update weights with momentum
3. Repeat until convergence
4. Make predictions using learned weights

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Basic Gradient Descent
For parameter θ and loss function L:
```
θ_new = θ_old - η * ∇L(θ_old)
```
where η is learning rate

#### With Momentum
```
v = γ * v - η * ∇L(θ)
θ = θ + v
```
where:
- v is velocity
- γ is momentum coefficient

## Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Works with any differentiable loss
- Can handle large datasets
- Converges to local minimum
- Memory efficient

## Limitations
- May get stuck in local minima
- Sensitive to learning rate
- Requires differentiable loss
- May converge slowly
- Needs careful initialization

## Time Complexity
- Training: O(n * p * h * i) where:
  - n is samples
  - p is features
  - h is hidden units
  - i is iterations
- Prediction: O(p * h)

## Space Complexity
- O(p * h) for weights
- O(b * p) for mini-batches
where b is batch size
