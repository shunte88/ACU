# Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network

## Overview
The Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network is a type of artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. It combines the advantages of neural networks with the power of kernel methods, making it particularly effective for function approximation and pattern recognition tasks.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **RBF Centers**: Prototype points in feature space
2. **Radial Basis Functions**: Gaussian-like activation functions
3. **Two-Layer Architecture**: Hidden RBF layer and linear output layer
4. **Local Approximation**: Each RBF unit responds to a local region

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize RBF centers (using clustering)
2. Compute RBF activations
3. Train output layer weights
4. Make predictions using trained network

### Mathematical Formulation

#### RBF Activation
For input x and center c:
```
φ(x, c) = exp(-γ ||x - c||²)
```
where γ is the width parameter

#### Network Output
For input x:
```
y = Σ w_i * φ(x, c_i) + b
```
where:
- w_i are weights
- c_i are centers
- b is bias

## Advantages
- Fast training
- Good generalization
- Local approximation
- Works well with small datasets
- Can handle non-linear problems

## Limitations
- Number of centers affects performance
- Sensitive to center placement
- May require many centers
- Computationally expensive for large datasets
- Memory intensive

## Time Complexity
- Training: O(n * m * p) where:
  - n is samples
  - m is centers
  - p is features
- Prediction: O(m * p)

## Space Complexity
- O(m * p) for centers
- O(m * k) for weights
where k is number of classes

## Use Cases
- Function approximation
- Pattern recognition
- Time series prediction
- Control systems
- Signal processing
