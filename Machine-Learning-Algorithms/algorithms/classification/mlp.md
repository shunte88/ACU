# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

## Overview
The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons. It's a powerful model capable of learning complex non-linear patterns through backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Multiple Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers
2. **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations
3. **Backpropagation**: Error propagation and weight updates
4. **Gradient Descent**: Optimization of network parameters

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize network weights and biases
2. Forward pass:
   - Compute activations for each layer
   - Apply activation functions
3. Backward pass:
   - Compute error gradients
   - Update weights and biases
4. Repeat until convergence

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Forward Pass
For layer l:
```
z^l = W^l * a^(l-1) + b^l
a^l = f(z^l)
```
where:
- W^l are weights
- b^l is bias
- f is activation function
- a^l is activation

#### Backpropagation
Error gradient for layer l:
```
δ^l = (W^(l+1))^T * δ^(l+1) * f'(z^l)
```

#### Weight Updates
```
W^l = W^l - η * δ^l * (a^(l-1))^T
b^l = b^l - η * δ^l
```

## Advantages

## Time Complexity
- Training: O(n * p * h * i) where:
  - n is samples
  - p is features
  - h is hidden units
  - i is iterations
- Prediction: O(p * h)

## Space Complexity
- O(p * h) for storing weights
