# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## 1. Overview
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal state (memory) that captures information about previous inputs. They are particularly effective for tasks involving time series, natural language, and other sequential data.
