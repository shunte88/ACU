# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## 1. Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks competing against each other: a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and synthetic data. This adversarial training process leads to the generation of high-quality synthetic data.
