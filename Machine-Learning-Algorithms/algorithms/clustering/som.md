# Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

## Overview
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), also known as Kohonen networks, are a type of artificial neural network that uses unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. They are particularly useful for visualizing and clustering high-dimensional data.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Neuron Grid**: A 2D grid of neurons, each with a weight vector
2. **Competitive Learning**: Neurons compete to represent input data
3. **Neighborhood Function**: Defines how neurons influence each other
4. **Adaptation**: Weights are updated based on input and neighborhood

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize neuron weights randomly
2. For each input vector:
   - Find the Best Matching Unit (BMU)
   - Update BMU and its neighbors
   - Decrease neighborhood size over time
3. Repeat until convergence

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Distance Calculation
For input vector x and neuron weight w:
```
d(x,w) = ||x - w||²
```

#### Neighborhood Function
Gaussian neighborhood function:
```
h(t) = exp(-d²/2σ²(t))
```
where σ(t) decreases over time.

#### Weight Update
```
w(t+1) = w(t) + α(t) * h(t) * (x - w(t))
```
where α(t) is the learning rate.

## Advantages

- Visualization capabilities
- Unsupervised learning
- Robust to noise
- Can handle missing data

## Limitations
- Requires careful parameter tuning
- Sensitive to initialization
- May get stuck in local optima
- Computationally expensive
- Grid size must be specified

## Time Complexity
- O(n*m*i)
  - n: number of input vectors
  - m: number of neurons
  - i: number of iterations

## Space Complexity
- O(m*d) for neuron weights
  - m: number of neurons
  - d: input dimension
