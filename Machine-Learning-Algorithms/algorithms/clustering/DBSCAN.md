# DBSCAN Clustering

## 1. Overview
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed and marks points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers. It does not require the number of clusters to be specified and can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.

### Type of Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Density-Based Clustering

### Key Characteristics
- Finds arbitrarily shaped clusters
- Identifies noise and outliers
- Does not require number of clusters (K)
- Relies on density parameters (eps, min_samples)
- Robust to outliers
- Works with spatial and non-spatial data

### When to Use
- Spatial data analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Clustering with noise/outliers
- Non-globular cluster shapes
- Data with varying densities

## 2. Historical Context
- Introduced by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, JÃ¶rg Sander, and Xiaowei Xu in 1996
- Widely used in spatial data mining, geospatial analysis, and anomaly detection
- Inspired many density-based clustering variants (e.g., OPTICS, HDBSCAN)

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Core Concepts
- **Neighborhood:** For a point $p$, its $\epsilon$-neighborhood is:
  $$
  N_\epsilon(p) = \{q \in D : d(p,q) \leq \epsilon\}
  $$
  where $D$ is the dataset and $d$ is the distance metric.

- **Core Point:** A point $p$ is a core point if:
  $$
  |N_\epsilon(p)| \geq \text{min\_samples}
  $$

- **Border Point:** A point $p$ is a border point if:
  $$
  |N_\epsilon(p)| < \text{min\_samples} \land \exists q \in N_\epsilon(p) : |N_\epsilon(q)| \geq \text{min\_samples}
  $$

- **Noise Point:** A point $p$ is noise if:
  $$
  |N_\epsilon(p)| < \text{min\_samples} \land \forall q \in N_\epsilon(p) : |N_\epsilon(q)| < \text{min\_samples}
  $$

#### Density-Reachability
- **Directly Density-Reachable:** Point $p$ is directly density-reachable from $q$ if:
  $$
  p \in N_\epsilon(q) \land |N_\epsilon(q)| \geq \text{min\_samples}
  $$

- **Density-Reachable:** Point $p$ is density-reachable from $q$ if there exists a chain of points $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ where:
  $$
  p_1 = q, p_n = p, \text{ and } p_{i+1} \text{ is directly density-reachable from } p_i
  $$

- **Density-Connected:** Points $p$ and $q$ are density-connected if there exists a point $o$ such that both $p$ and $q$ are density-reachable from $o$.

#### Cluster Definition
A cluster $C$ is a non-empty subset of $D$ satisfying:
1. **Maximality:** If $p \in C$ and $q$ is density-reachable from $p$, then $q \in C$
2. **Connectivity:** For any points $p, q \in C$, $p$ and $q$ are density-connected

### Training Process

#### Algorithm Steps
1. For each point, find all points within eps (neighborhood)
2. If a point is a core point, form a cluster
3. Expand the cluster by recursively adding all density-reachable points
4. Mark points not belonging to any cluster as noise

#### Key Parameters
- eps: Neighborhood radius
- min_samples: Minimum points to form a dense region
- Distance metric (usually Euclidean)

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Without spatial index: $O(n^2 \cdot d)$
  - With KD-tree: $O(n \log n \cdot d)$
  - With Ball-tree: $O(n \log n \cdot d)$
  where:
  - $n$ = number of samples
  - $d$ = number of features

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(\log n \cdot d)$ per point with spatial index
  - $O(n \cdot d)$ per point without spatial index

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Data points: $O(n \cdot d)$
  - Spatial index: $O(n \cdot d)$
  - Neighborhood sets: $O(n \cdot \text{avg\_neighbors})$
  - Cluster assignments: $O(n)$

- **Prediction:**
  - Spatial index: $O(n \cdot d)$
  - Cluster assignments: $O(n)$

### Computational Requirements
- Memory efficient with spatial indexing
- Fast neighborhood queries with tree structures
