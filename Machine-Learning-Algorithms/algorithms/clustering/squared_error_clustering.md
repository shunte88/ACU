# Squared Error Clustering

## Overview
Squared Error Clustering is a clustering algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors between data points and their cluster centers. It is similar to K-means but uses a different optimization criterion and can handle various distance metrics.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Squared Error**: Sum of squared distances between points and their cluster centers
2. **Cluster Center**: Mean or median of points in a cluster
3. **Optimization**: Minimizing total squared error

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize cluster centers
2. Assign points to nearest centers
3. Update centers to minimize squared error
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Squared Error
For a set of clusters C and centers M:
```
E = Σ Σ ||x - m||² for x ∈ C, m ∈ M
```
where ||x - m|| is the distance between point x and center m.

#### Center Update
For each cluster C:
```
m = argmin_m Σ ||x - m||² for x ∈ C
```

## Advantages
- Simple and intuitive
- Works with any distance metric
- Converges to local minimum
- Easy to implement
- Good for spherical clusters

## Limitations
- Requires number of clusters (k)
- Sensitive to initialization
- May converge to local optima
- Assumes spherical clusters
- Not suitable for non-globular shapes

## Time Complexity
- O(n*k*i)
  - n: number of points
  - k: number of clusters
  - i: number of iterations

## Space Complexity
- O(n*k) for assignments
- O(k*d) for centers
  - d: number of features

## Use Cases
- Customer segmentation
- Document clustering
- Image segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Bioinformatics

## Best Practices
1. Choose appropriate k value
2. Select suitable distance metric
3. Handle outliers appropriately
4. Use multiple initializations
5. Consider data preprocessing
