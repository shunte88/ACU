# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Clustering

## Overview
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) clustering is a hierarchical clustering method that uses graph theory concepts to identify clusters. It builds a minimum spanning tree of the data points and then removes the longest edges to form clusters.

## Algorithm Description

### Key Concepts
1. **Minimum Spanning Tree**: A tree that connects all vertices with minimum total edge weight
2. **Edge Weight**: Distance between data points
3. **Cluster Formation**: Removing longest edges to form clusters

### Algorithm Steps
1. Compute pairwise distances between all points
2. Construct minimum spanning tree
3. Sort edges by weight in descending order
4. Remove k-1 longest edges to form k clusters
5. Assign cluster labels based on connected components

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Distance Matrix
For n data points, compute n×n distance matrix D where:
```
D[i,j] = d(xi, xj)
```
where d is the distance metric.

#### MST Construction
Using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to find MST:
```
MST = {(i,j) | i,j are connected in the tree}
```

#### Cluster Formation
Remove k-1 longest edges from MST to form k clusters:
```
Clusters = ConnectedComponents(MST - {longest k-1 edges})
```

## Advantages
- No need to specify number of clusters a priori
- Can handle non-globular clusters
- Works with any distance metric
- Produces hierarchical structure
- Robust to noise

## Limitations
- Computationally expensive
- Sensitive to edge removal
- May not work well with high-dimensional data
- Memory intensive for large datasets
- Requires distance matrix

## Time Complexity
- O(n²) for distance computation
- O(n² log n) for MST construction
- O(n) for cluster formation
- Total: O(n² log n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n²) for distance matrix
- O(n) for MST
- O(n) for cluster assignments

## Use Cases
- Image segmentation

## Best Practices
1. Choose appropriate distance metric
2. Consider data preprocessing
3. Handle outliers appropriately
4. Select suitable edge removal strategy
5. Validate cluster quality
