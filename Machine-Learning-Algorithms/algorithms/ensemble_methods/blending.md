# Blending

## 1. Overview
Blending is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models using a meta-learner. It's particularly effective for improving prediction accuracy by learning the optimal way to combine different models' predictions.

### Type of Learning
- Ensemble Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Meta-learning
- Stacked Generalization

### Key Characteristics
- Meta-learner approach
- Two-level training
- Model combination
- Flexible architecture
- Improved accuracy

### When to Use
- Complex prediction tasks
- When base models are diverse
- When accuracy is critical
- When overfitting is a concern
- When computational resources allow

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed as a variant of stacking
- Popularized in Kaggle competitions
- Evolved with deep learning
- Widely used in practice
- Still actively researched

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Meta-features:
$$
X_{meta} = [f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_m(x)]
$$

Final Prediction:
$$
\hat{y} = g(X_{meta})
$$

where:
- $f_i$ are base models
- $g$ is the meta-learner
- $x$ is the input vector
- $m$ is the number of models

### Training Process
1. Split training data
2. Train base models
3. Generate meta-features
4. Train meta-learner
5. Make predictions
6. Evaluate performance

### Key Parameters
- Base model selection
- Meta-learner type
- Validation split

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Training: O(n × m + n × k)
- Prediction: O(m + k)

where:
- n = sample size
- m = number of base models
- k = meta-learner complexity

### Space Complexity
- O(m × n) for base models
- O(k) for meta-learner
- O(n) for meta-features

### Computational Requirements
