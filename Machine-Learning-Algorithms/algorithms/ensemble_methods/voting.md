# Voting

## 1. Overview
Voting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models by taking a majority vote (classification) or average (regression) of their predictions. It's particularly effective for improving prediction accuracy and robustness by leveraging the collective wisdom of multiple models.

### Type of Learning
- Ensemble Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Model Aggregation
- Parallel Ensemble

### Key Characteristics
- Simple aggregation
- Parallel training
- Model diversity
- Improved robustness
- Easy implementation

### When to Use
- Classification tasks
- Regression problems
- When models are diverse
- When interpretability is important
- When computational resources allow

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed from early ensemble methods
- Evolved with machine learning
- Popularized in practice
- Widely used in industry
- Still actively researched

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Hard Voting (Classification):
$$
\hat{y} = \text{mode}(\{f_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m)
$$

Soft Voting (Classification):
$$
\hat{y} = \arg\max_k \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m P_k(f_i(x))
$$

Average Voting (Regression):
$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(x)
$$

where:
- $f_i$ are base models
- $x$ is the input vector
- $m$ is the number of models
- $P_k$ is the probability of class k
