# Random Forests

## 1. Overview
Random Forests is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

### Type of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Ensemble Learning
- Classification and Regression Tasks

### Key Characteristics
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
- Random feature selection
- Parallelizable training
- Built-in feature importance
- Robust to overfitting

### When to Use
- When you need high accuracy
- When you want to understand feature importance
- When you need a robust model
- When you have a large dataset
- When you want to handle missing values
- When you need to capture non-linear relationships

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed by Leo Breiman in 2001
- Extension of bagging and random subspace method
- Combines ideas from:
  - Bootstrap aggregation (Breiman, 1994)
  - Random subspace method (Ho, 1998)
- Became popular due to its performance and robustness
- Foundation for many modern ensemble methods

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Random Forests combine multiple decision trees through bootstrap aggregation and random feature selection:

#### Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)
For a dataset $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, create $B$ bootstrap samples $\{D_b\}_{b=1}^B$ by sampling with replacement. Each tree $T_b$ is trained on $D_b$.

#### Random Feature Selection
At each split, select $m_{try}$ features from $d$ total features:
- **Classification:** $m_{try} = \lfloor \sqrt{d} \rfloor$
- **Regression:** $m_{try} = \lfloor d/3 \rfloor$

#### Tree Building
For each tree $T_b$:
1. Start with root node containing all samples
2. For each node:
   - Select random feature subset $F \subset \{1,\ldots,d\}, |F| = m_{try}$
   - Find optimal split $(j^*, t^*)$:
     $$
     (j^*, t^*) = \arg\max_{j \in F, t} \text{Gain}(j, t)
     $$
   - Split node into left and right children
3. Continue until stopping criteria met

#### Ensemble Prediction
- **Classification:**
  $$
  \hat{y} = \arg\max_c \sum_{b=1}^B \mathbb{I}(T_b(x) = c)
  $$
- **Regression:**
  $$
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B T_b(x)
  $$

#### Feature Importance
For feature $j$, importance is measured by:
$$
\text{Importance}(j) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \sum_{t \in T_b} \Delta I(t, j)
$$
where $\Delta I(t, j)$ is the impurity decrease at node $t$ due to feature $j$.

#### Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error
For each sample $(x_i, y_i)$, compute error using trees where it was not in bootstrap sample:
$$
\text{OOB Error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i \neq y_i)
$$
where $\hat{y}_i$ is the majority vote/mean of OOB predictions.

### Training Process
1. Create bootstrap samples
2. For each sample:
   - Build decision tree
   - Select random feature subset
   - Find best split
   - Grow tree to maximum depth
3. Combine predictions

### Key Parameters
- Number of trees
- Maximum tree depth
- Minimum samples per leaf
- Minimum samples for split
- Maximum features per split
- Bootstrap sample size
- Class weights

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - For each tree:
    - Bootstrap sampling: $O(n)$
    - Tree building: $O(n \log n \cdot m_{try})$
  - Total training: $O(B \cdot n \log n \cdot m_{try})$
  where:
  - $B$ = number of trees
  - $n$ = number of samples
  - $m_{try}$ = number of features per split

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(B \cdot D)$ per sample
  - $O(N \cdot B \cdot D)$ for $N$ samples
  where $D$ is the average tree depth

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Tree structures: $O(B \cdot 2^D \cdot m_{try})$
  - Bootstrap samples: $O(B \cdot n)$
  - Feature values: $O(n \cdot d)$
  - Total: $O(B \cdot (2^D \cdot m_{try} + n) + n \cdot d)$

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(B \cdot 2^D \cdot m_{try})$ for storing the forest
