# Random Forest

## 1. Overview
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is a type of bagging ensemble method that uses decision trees as the base learners.

### Key Characteristics
- Type of Learning: Supervised Learning
- Model Type: Ensemble Method
- Base Learners: Decision Trees
- Training Method: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

### When to Use
- Classification and regression tasks
- High-dimensional data
- Need for feature importance
- Robust to overfitting
- Handling missing values
- Dealing with non-linear relationships

## 2. Historical Context
Random Forest was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler in 2001. It builds upon the concept of bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and decision trees, combining them to create a more robust and accurate model.

### Key Developments
- 2001: Introduction of Random Forest algorithm
- 2004: Extension to handle missing values
- 2006: Improvements in feature importance calculation
- 2010s: Integration with deep learning and other modern techniques

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Decision Tree Building
For each tree in the forest:

1. Bootstrap Sampling:
   $$ D_b = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n \text{ where } (x_i, y_i) \sim D \text{ with replacement} $$

2. Feature Selection:
   $$ F_b = \text{random subset of } F \text{ where } |F_b| = \sqrt{|F|} $$

3. Tree Construction:
   $$ T_b = \text{BuildTree}(D_b, F_b) $$

#### Prediction
For classification:
$$ \hat{y} = \text{mode}\{T_b(x)\}_{b=1}^B $$

For regression:
$$ \hat{y} = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B T_b(x) $$

#### Feature Importance
$$ \text{Importance}(f) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \sum_{t \in T_b} \frac{N_t}{N} \Delta I(t,f) $$

Where:
- $B$ is the number of trees
- $N_t$ is the number of samples in node $t$
- $N$ is the total number of samples
- $\Delta I(t,f)$ is the impurity decrease for feature $f$ at node $t$

### Core Components
1. Bootstrap Sampling
2. Random Feature Selection
3. Decision Tree Construction
4. Ensemble Aggregation

### Training Process
1. Create bootstrap samples from the training data
2. For each bootstrap sample:
   - Select random subset of features
   - Build a decision tree
   - Store the tree in the forest
3. For prediction:
   - Get predictions from all trees
   - Aggregate predictions (majority voting for classification, averaging for regression)

### Key Parameters
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples required to split a node
- `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum samples required in a leaf node
- `max_features`: Number of features to consider for each split

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Training: $O(B \cdot n \cdot d \cdot \log(n))$
  - $B$: number of trees
  - $n$: number of samples
  - $d$: number of features
- Prediction: $O(B \cdot \log(n))$

### Space Complexity
- Training: $O(B \cdot n \cdot d)$
- Prediction: $O(B \cdot n)$

### Computational Requirements
- Memory: Moderate to high (depends on number of trees)
- CPU: Parallelizable
- GPU: Not typically required

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling: Yes (parallel tree building)
- Vertical scaling: Yes (more trees, deeper trees)
- Data size: Handles large datasets well
