# LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

## 1. Overview
LightGBM is a highly efficient gradient boosting framework that uses a leaf-wise tree growth strategy instead of level-wise. It is designed to be faster and more memory-efficient than traditional gradient boosting implementations while maintaining high accuracy.

### Type of Learning

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

LightGBM optimizes a regularized objective function while using efficient tree building strategies:

#### Objective Function
For a tree ensemble with $K$ trees:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^K \Omega(f_k)
$$
where:
- $l$ is the loss function
- $\Omega$ is the regularization term
- $f_k$ is the $k$-th tree

#### Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS)
For each iteration, samples are selected based on gradients:
1. Sort instances by gradient magnitude
2. Select top $a \times 100\%$ instances
3. Randomly sample $b \times 100\%$ from remaining instances
4. Scale gradients of sampled instances by $\frac{1-a}{b}$

#### Histogram-based Algorithm
For each feature, values are discretized into bins:
$$
h(x) = \lfloor \frac{x - x_{min}}{\Delta x} \rfloor
$$
where $\Delta x = \frac{x_{max} - x_{min}}{n_{bins}}$

#### Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)
Features are bundled based on conflict count:
$$
\text{conflict}(f_i, f_j) = \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{I}(f_i^k \neq 0 \land f_j^k \neq 0)
$$
where $f_i^k$ is the $k$-th value of feature $i$.

#### Leaf-wise Tree Growth
For each leaf, the optimal split is found by maximizing:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{split} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{(\sum_{i \in I_L} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I_L} h_i + \lambda} + \frac{(\sum_{i \in I_R} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I_R} h_i + \lambda} - \frac{(\sum_{i \in I} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I} h_i + \lambda}\right] - \gamma
$$
where:
- $g_i$ is the first-order gradient
- $h_i$ is the second-order gradient
- $I_L, I_R$ are the instance sets of left and right nodes

### Training Process
1. Initialize model
2. For each iteration:
   - Sample data using GOSS
   - Build histogram
   - Find best split
   - Grow tree leaf-wise
3. Apply regularization

- Min data in leaf
- Feature fraction
- Bagging fraction

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - For each tree:
    - GOSS sampling: $O(n \log n)$
    - Histogram building: $O(n \cdot d)$
    - Split finding: $O(n \log n \cdot d)$
    - Leaf-wise growth: $O(L \log n)$
  - Total training: $O(K(n \log n \cdot d + L \log n))$
  where:
  - $K$ = number of trees
  - $n$ = number of samples
  - $d$ = number of features
  - $L$ = number of leaves

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(K \log L)$ per sample
  - $O(N K \log L)$ for $N$ samples

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Tree structure: $O(K \cdot L \cdot d)$
  - Histograms: $O(d \cdot n_{bins})$
  - Gradient storage: $O(n)$
  where $n_{bins}$ is the number of histogram bins

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(K \cdot L \cdot d)$ for storing the ensemble
