# ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 1. Overview
ARIMA is a statistical model used for time series forecasting that combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average components. It's particularly effective for non-stationary time series data and has been a fundamental tool in time series analysis.

### Type of Learning
- Time Series Analysis
- Statistical Modeling
- Forecasting
- Parametric Modeling

### Key Characteristics
- Handles non-stationary time series
- Combines autoregression and moving averages
- Uses differencing for stationarity
- Provides probabilistic forecasts
- Captures temporal dependencies

### When to Use
- Univariate time series forecasting
- When data shows trends and seasonality
- Medium to long-term forecasting
- When interpretability is important
- When data is non-stationary

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed by Box and Jenkins in 1970s
- Based on earlier work in time series analysis
- Became a standard in statistical forecasting
- Widely used in econometrics
- Still fundamental in time series analysis

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

ARIMA(p,d,q) model is defined as:

$$
(1-\sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i L^i)(1-L)^d y_t = (1+\sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i L^i)\epsilon_t
$$

where:
- $p$ is the autoregressive order
- $d$ is the differencing order
- $q$ is the moving average order
- $\phi_i$ are AR parameters
- $\theta_i$ are MA parameters
- $L$ is the lag operator
- $\epsilon_t$ is white noise

### Training Process
1. Check stationarity
2. Apply differencing if needed
3. Identify model orders (p,d,q)
4. Estimate parameters
5. Validate model
6. Make forecasts

### Key Parameters
- p (AR order)
- d (differencing order)
- q (MA order)
- Seasonal components (P,D,Q)
- Seasonal period (s)

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Parameter estimation: O(n²)
- Forecasting: O(n)
- Model selection: O(n³)

where:
- n = number of observations

### Space Complexity
- O(n) for data storage
- O(p+q) for parameters
- O(n) for forecasts

### Computational Requirements
- Moderate computational power
- Memory for parameter estimation
- Efficient matrix operations
- Numerical stability

## 5. Practical Applications
- Economic forecasting
- Sales prediction
- Weather forecasting
- Stock market analysis
- Energy consumption
- Demand forecasting

## 6. Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
