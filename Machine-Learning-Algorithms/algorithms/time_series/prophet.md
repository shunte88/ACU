- Active development and community

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Prophet decomposes time series into components:

$$
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t
$$

where:
- $g(t)$ is the trend component
- $s(t)$ is the seasonal component
- $h(t)$ is the holiday component
- $\epsilon_t$ is the error term

Trend component:
$$
g(t) = (k + \mathbf{a}(t)^T \boldsymbol{\delta})t + (m + \mathbf{a}(t)^T \boldsymbol{\gamma})
$$

Seasonal component:
$$
s(t) = \sum_{n=1}^N (a_n \cos(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}) + b_n \sin(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}))
$$

### Training Process
1. Data preprocessing
