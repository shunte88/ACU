# Policy Gradient

## 1. Overview
Policy Gradient is a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of expected return. It represents a different approach from value-based methods, focusing on directly learning the optimal policy.

### Type of Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Policy-based Learning
- Model-free Learning
- Direct Policy Optimization

### Key Characteristics
- Directly optimizes policy parameters
- Can handle continuous action spaces
- Works with stochastic policies
- Provides smooth policy updates
- Can learn non-deterministic policies

### When to Use
- Continuous action spaces
- When policy representation is important
- Problems requiring stochastic policies
- When value function is hard to estimate
- Complex control problems

## 2. Historical Context
- Based on REINFORCE algorithm (1992)
- Evolved through various improvements
- Led to modern algorithms like PPO and TRPO
- Fundamental in actor-critic methods
- Still widely used in practice

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

The policy gradient theorem states:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s,a) R_t]
$$

where:
- $\theta$ are the policy parameters
- $\pi_\theta$ is the policy
- $R_t$ is the return
- $s$ is the state
- $a$ is the action

### Training Process
1. Initialize policy parameters
2. Collect trajectories using current policy
3. Compute returns for each trajectory
4. Calculate policy gradient
5. Update policy parameters
6. Repeat until convergence

### Key Parameters
- Learning rate
- Policy network architecture
- Baseline function
- Entropy coefficient
- Discount factor
- Number of trajectories

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Forward pass: O(B × N)
- Backward pass: O(B × N)
- Trajectory collection: O(T × E)

where:
- B = batch size
- N = network size
- T = trajectory length
- E = number of environments

### Space Complexity
- O(N) for policy parameters
- O(B × T) for trajectories
- O(B × N) for gradients

### Computational Requirements
