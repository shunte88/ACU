# Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## 1. Overview
Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks. It was developed by DeepMind and represents a breakthrough in combining deep learning with reinforcement learning.

### Type of Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning
- Value-based Learning
- Model-free Learning

### Key Characteristics
- Uses deep neural networks to approximate Q-values
- Implements experience replay for stability
- Uses target networks to reduce overestimation
- Handles high-dimensional state spaces
- Can learn from raw sensory input

### When to Use
- Complex environments with high-dimensional state spaces
- When raw sensory input needs to be processed
- Problems requiring function approximation
- When traditional Q-learning is infeasible
- Real-world applications with complex state representations

## 2. Historical Context
- Introduced by DeepMind in 2013
- First successful deep RL algorithm
- Achieved human-level performance in Atari games
- Revolutionized the field of deep reinforcement learning
- Led to many improvements and variants

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

DQN minimizes the following loss function:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim D}[(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta^-) - Q(s, a; \theta))^2]
$$

where:
- $\theta$ are the network parameters
- $\theta^-$ are the target network parameters
- $D$ is the replay memory
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor

### Training Process
1. Initialize main and target networks
2. Collect experience in replay memory
3. Sample random batch from memory
4. Compute target Q-values
5. Update network parameters
6. Periodically update target network

### Key Parameters
