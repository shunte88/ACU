# Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS)

## Overview
Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) is an ensemble learning method that dynamically selects the most appropriate classifier for each test instance based on local accuracy in the neighborhood of the test instance. This approach adapts to the local characteristics of the data space.

## Key Features
- Dynamic classifier selection based on local performance
- K-nearest neighbors for local accuracy estimation
- Adapts to different regions of the feature space
- Compatible with any base classifier

## Algorithm Details

### Training Process
1. Train all base classifiers on the training data
2. Train a KNN model for finding neighbors
3. Store training data and labels for local accuracy calculation

### Prediction Process
1. For each test instance:
   - Find k-nearest neighbors in the training set
   - Calculate local accuracy of each classifier in the neighborhood
   - Select the best performing classifier
   - Use the selected classifier to make the prediction

## Implementation Details

### Parameters
- `base_classifiers`: List of base classifier instances
- `k_neighbors`: Number of neighbors to consider for local accuracy estimation (default: 5)

### Methods
- `fit(X, y)`: Train the ensemble
- `predict(X)`: Predict class labels
- `predict_proba(X)`: Predict class probabilities

## Use Cases
- When different classifiers perform better in different regions of the feature space
- When you want to leverage local expertise of classifiers
- When you need an adaptive ensemble that responds to local data characteristics
- When dealing with complex, non-uniform data distributions

## Advantages
- Adapts to local data characteristics
- Can handle complex decision boundaries
- More flexible than static ensemble methods
- Can improve performance in heterogeneous data spaces

## Limitations
- Computationally expensive due to nearest neighbor search
- Sensitive to the choice of k (number of neighbors)
- May be affected by noise in the training data
- Requires storing the training data for local accuracy calculation

## Example Usage
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from dcs import DynamicClassifierSelection

# Create base classifiers
classifiers = [
    RandomForestClassifier(),
    SVC(probability=True),
    KNeighborsClassifier()
]

# Create and train DCS ensemble
dcs = DynamicClassifierSelection(classifiers, k_neighbors=5)
dcs.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = dcs.predict(X_test)
probabilities = dcs.predict_proba(X_test)
```
