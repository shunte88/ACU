## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

XGBoost optimizes a regularized objective function that combines a loss function and model complexity:

#### Objective Function
For a tree ensemble with $K$ trees:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^K \Omega(f_k)
$$
where:
- $l$ is the loss function
- $\Omega$ is the regularization term
- $f_k$ is the $k$-th tree

#### Tree Structure
Each tree $f_k$ is defined as:
$$
f_k(x) = w_{q(x)}
$$
where:
- $q(x)$ maps input $x$ to a leaf index
- $w$ is the vector of leaf weights

#### Regularization
The regularization term for a tree is:
$$
\Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \|w\|^2
$$
where:
- $T$ is the number of leaves
- $\gamma$ is the minimum loss reduction
- $\lambda$ is the L2 regularization parameter

#### Tree Building
For each node, the optimal split is found by maximizing:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{split} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{(\sum_{i \in I_L} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I_L} h_i + \lambda} + \frac{(\sum_{i \in I_R} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I_R} h_i + \lambda} - \frac{(\sum_{i \in I} g_i)^2}{\sum_{i \in I} h_i + \lambda}\right] - \gamma
$$
where:
- $g_i$ is the first-order gradient
- $h_i$ is the second-order gradient
- $I_L, I_R$ are the instance sets of left and right nodes

#### Weight Calculation
The optimal weight for a leaf is:
$$
w_j^* = -\frac{\sum_{i \in I_j} g_i}{\sum_{i \in I_j} h_i + \lambda}
$$
where $I_j$ is the instance set of leaf $j$.

### Training Process
1. Initialize model
2. For each iteration:
   - Calculate gradients
   - Build tree structure
   - Find optimal weights
   - Update model
3. Apply regularization

### Key Parameters
- Learning rate
- Max depth
- Min child weight
- Subsample ratio
- Column sample ratio
- L1/L2 regularization
- Gamma (minimum loss reduction)

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - For each tree:
    - Gradient computation: $O(n)$
    - Split finding: $O(n \log n \cdot d)$
    - Weight calculation: $O(n)$
  - Total training: $O(K n \log n \cdot d)$
  where:
  - $K$ = number of trees
  - $n$ = number of samples
  - $d$ = number of features

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(K \log n)$ per sample
  - $O(N K \log n)$ for $N$ samples

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Tree structure: $O(K \cdot 2^D \cdot d)$
  - Gradient storage: $O(n)$
  - Feature values: $O(n \cdot d)$
  where $D$ is the maximum tree depth

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(K \cdot 2^D \cdot d)$ for storing the ensemble
