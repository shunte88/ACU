# Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

## 1. Overview
Self-Organizing Map is a type of artificial neural network that uses unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. It's particularly effective for visualization and clustering of complex data.

### Type of Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Neural Networks
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering

### Key Characteristics
- Competitive learning
- Neighborhood preservation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Topological ordering
- Visualization capabilities

### When to Use
- Data visualization
- Pattern recognition
- Clustering
- Feature extraction
- Dimensionality reduction

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed by Teuvo Kohonen in 1982
- Based on competitive learning
- Evolved through various improvements
- Widely used in industry
- Still actively researched

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Neighborhood function:
$$
h_{ij}(t) = \exp(-\frac{||r_i - r_j||^2}{2\sigma^2(t)})
$$

Weight update:
$$
w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) + \alpha(t)h_{ij}(t)(x - w_i(t))
$$

where:
- $h_{ij}(t)$ is the neighborhood function
- $r_i$ is the position of neuron i
- $\sigma(t)$ is the neighborhood radius
- $\alpha(t)$ is the learning rate
- $x$ is the input vector

### Training Process
1. Initialize weights
2. Select input vector
3. Find best matching unit
4. Update weights
5. Decrease learning rate
6. Repeat until convergence

### Key Parameters
- Map size
- Learning rate
- Neighborhood radius
- Number of iterations
- Initialization method
- Distance metric

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Training: O(n × m × i)
- Mapping: O(n × m)

where:
- n = number of samples
