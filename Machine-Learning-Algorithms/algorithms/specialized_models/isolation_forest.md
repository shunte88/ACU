# Isolation Forest

## 1. Overview
Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection algorithm that works by isolating observations in random trees. It's particularly effective for detecting outliers in high-dimensional data and is computationally efficient compared to traditional distance-based methods.

### Type of Learning
- Anomaly Detection
- Unsupervised Learning
- Tree-based Methods
- Outlier Detection

### Key Characteristics
- Random partitioning
- Tree-based isolation
- Anomaly scoring
- Efficient computation
- Scalable to large datasets

### When to Use
- High-dimensional data
- Large-scale datasets
- Real-time anomaly detection
- When computation speed is important
- When interpretability is needed

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed by Liu et al. in 2008
- Introduced at ICDM 2008
- Gained popularity in industry
- Extended with various improvements
- Still widely used in practice

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Anomaly Score:
$$
s(x,n) = 2^{-\frac{E(h(x))}{c(n)}}
$$

where:
- $E(h(x))$ is the average path length
- $c(n)$ is the average path length of unsuccessful search
- $n$ is the number of samples

Average Path Length:
$$
c(n) = 2H(n-1) - \frac{2(n-1)}{n}
$$

where $H(n)$ is the harmonic number.

### Training Process
1. Randomly select features
2. Randomly select split values
3. Build isolation trees
4. Calculate path lengths
5. Compute anomaly scores
6. Determine threshold

### Key Parameters
