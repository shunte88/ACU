# Gradient Boosting

## 1. Overview
Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning method that builds models sequentially, where each new model attempts to correct the errors made by previous models. It combines weak learners (typically decision trees) into a strong learner through an iterative process of minimizing a loss function.

### Type of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Ensemble Learning
- Classification and Regression Tasks

### Key Characteristics
- Sequential model building
- Gradient descent optimization
- Adaptive boosting
- Shrinkage (learning rate)
- Tree-based weak learners
- Regularization techniques

### When to Use
- When you need high accuracy
- When you have structured/tabular data
- When you want to capture complex patterns
- When you have sufficient training data
- When you need to handle mixed data types
- When interpretability is not the primary concern

## 2. Historical Context
- First introduced by Leo Breiman in 1997
- Popularized by Jerome Friedman in 1999
- Extended to various loss functions
- Basis for many modern implementations:
  - XGBoost (2014)
  - LightGBM (2016)
  - CatBoost (2017)
- Widely used in competitions and production

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Gradient Boosting builds an ensemble of models $F_M(x)$ by sequentially adding weak learners $h_m(x)$ to minimize a loss function $L(y, F(x))$.

#### General Algorithm
For $m = 1$ to $M$:

1. Compute negative gradient (pseudo-residuals):
   $$
   r_{im} = -\left[\frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)}\right]_{F(x)=F_{m-1}(x)}
   $$

2. Fit weak learner $h_m(x)$ to pseudo-residuals:
   $$
   h_m = \arg\min_h \sum_{i=1}^n (r_{im} - h(x_i))^2
   $$

3. Find optimal step size:
   $$
   \gamma_m = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \gamma h_m(x_i))
   $$

4. Update model:
   $$
   F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \nu \gamma_m h_m(x)
   $$
   where $\nu$ is the learning rate.

#### Common Loss Functions
- **Regression (MSE):**
  $$
  L(y, F) = \frac{1}{2}(y - F)^2
  $$
- **Classification (Log Loss):**
  $$
  L(y, F) = \log(1 + e^{-yF})
  $$
- **Huber Loss:**
  $$
  L(y, F) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2}(y - F)^2 & \text{if } |y - F| \leq \delta \\
  \delta(|y - F| - \frac{\delta}{2}) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

#### Regularization
- **L1 (Lasso):**
  $$
  \Omega(h) = \lambda \sum_{j=1}^J |w_j|
  $$
- **L2 (Ridge):**
  $$
  \Omega(h) = \lambda \sum_{j=1}^J w_j^2
  $$
where $w_j$ are the leaf weights.

### Training Process
1. Initialize model with constant value
2. For each iteration:
   - Compute negative gradient
   - Fit tree to gradient
   - Find optimal step size
   - Update model
3. Combine all trees

### Key Parameters
- Number of trees
- Learning rate
- Maximum tree depth
- Minimum samples per leaf
- Subsample ratio
- Feature sampling
- Regularization parameters

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - For each tree $m$:
    - Gradient computation: $O(n)$
    - Tree building: $O(n \log n \cdot d)$
    - Step size optimization: $O(n)$
  - Total training: $O(M n \log n \cdot d)$
  where:
  - $M$ = number of trees
  - $n$ = number of samples
  - $d$ = number of features

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(M \log n)$ per sample
  - $O(N M \log n)$ for $N$ samples

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Tree structure: $O(M \cdot 2^D \cdot d)$
  - Gradient storage: $O(n)$
  where $D$ is the maximum tree depth

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(M \cdot 2^D \cdot d)$ for storing the ensemble
