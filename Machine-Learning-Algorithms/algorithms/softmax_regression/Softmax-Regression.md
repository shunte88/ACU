# Softmax Regression

## 1. Overview
Softmax Regression, also known as Multinomial Logistic Regression, is a generalization of Logistic Regression that handles multi-class classification problems. It extends the binary classification capabilities of Logistic Regression to multiple classes by using the softmax function to model class probabilities.

### Type of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Multi-class Classification Task

### Key Characteristics
- Models probability distribution over multiple classes
- Uses softmax function for probability normalization
- Provides probabilistic predictions for each class
- Linear decision boundaries between classes
- Interpretable class-specific coefficients

### When to Use
- Multi-class classification problems
- When probability estimates for each class are needed
- When interpretability is important
- As a baseline model for multi-class problems
- When features are linearly separable

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed as an extension of Logistic Regression
- First formalized in the 1970s
- Became fundamental in statistical analysis
- Evolved with the development of regularization techniques
- Widely used in deep learning as the final layer

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

Softmax Regression generalizes logistic regression to multi-class problems. For $K$ classes, the probability that $y$ belongs to class $k$ is:

$$
P(y=k|x) = \frac{e^{\beta_k^T x}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{\beta_j^T x}}
$$

where:
- $\beta_k$ is the coefficient vector for class $k$
- $x$ is the feature vector
- $K$ is the number of classes

#### Cost Function (Cross-Entropy)
The cost function to minimize is:

$$
J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K y_{ik} \log P(y_i = k | x_i)
$$
where $y_{ik}$ is 1 if sample $i$ belongs to class $k$, 0 otherwise.

#### Regularization
- **L2 (Ridge):**
  $$
  J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K y_{ik} \log P(y_i = k | x_i) + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^K ||\beta_k||^2
  $$
- **L1 (Lasso):**
  $$
  J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K y_{ik} \log P(y_i = k | x_i) + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^K ||\beta_k||_1
  $$

#### Optimization
Parameters are estimated using gradient descent or advanced optimizers.

### Training Process
1. Initialize coefficients for each class
2. Calculate probabilities using softmax function
3. Compute cost function (Cross-Entropy)
4. Update coefficients using gradient descent
5. Repeat until convergence

### Key Parameters
- Learning rate
- Number of iterations
- Regularization strength (L1/L2)
- Convergence criteria
- Class weights (for imbalanced data)

## 4. Performance Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- **Gradient Descent:** $O(m n K i)$
- **Advanced Solvers:** $O(m n K^2)$ per iteration

where:
- $m$ = number of samples
- $n$ = number of features
- $K$ = number of classes
- $i$ = number of iterations

#### Space Complexity
- $O(m n)$ for data
- $O(n K)$ for coefficients

#### Scalability
- Computational cost increases with $K$
- Efficient for moderate $K$ and $n$
