# SPRINT (Scalable PaRallelizable INduction of decision Trees)

## Overview
SPRINT is a scalable and parallelizable decision tree induction algorithm designed for handling large datasets efficiently. It extends traditional decision tree algorithms by incorporating parallel processing capabilities, making it suitable for big data applications. The algorithm maintains the interpretability of decision trees while significantly improving their training speed through parallelization.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Training: O(n log n) with parallel processing, where n is the number of samples
  - Prediction: O(log n) per sample
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the tree structure

## Key Components

### 1. Node Structure
- Feature index for splitting
- Threshold value for binary split
- Left and right child nodes
- Leaf node value (for classification)
- Impurity measure
- Number of samples
- Class distribution

### 2. Parallel Processing
- Feature-wise parallel split evaluation
- Multi-core utilization
- Process pool management
- Workload distribution

### 3. Splitting Criterion
- Gini impurity for classification
- Parallel threshold evaluation
- Best split selection across features

### 4. Stopping Criteria
- Maximum tree depth
- Minimum samples per split
- Minimum impurity decrease
- Pure node detection
