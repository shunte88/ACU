# RainForest Algorithm

## Overview
RainForest is a scalable decision tree algorithm that uses Attribute-Value-Class (AVC) sets to efficiently handle large datasets. It maintains a compact representation of the data distribution at each node, making it particularly suitable for memory-constrained environments and large-scale applications. The algorithm achieves scalability by using AVC sets to summarize the data distribution instead of storing the actual data points.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Training: O(n log n), where n is the number of samples
  - Prediction: O(log n) per sample
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the tree structure and AVC sets

## Key Components

### 1. AVC Sets (Attribute-Value-Class)
- Compact representation of data distribution
- Maps features to value-class distributions
- Efficient memory usage
- Fast split evaluation

### 2. Node Structure
- Feature index for splitting
- Threshold value for binary split
- Left and right child nodes
- Leaf node value (for classification)
- Impurity measure
- Number of samples
- Class distribution
- AVC sets

### 3. Splitting Criterion
- Gini impurity for classification
- AVC-based split evaluation
- Threshold optimization
- Impurity decrease calculation

### 4. Stopping Criteria
