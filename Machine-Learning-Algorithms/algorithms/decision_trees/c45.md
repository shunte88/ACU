# C4.5

## Overview
C4.5 is an extension of the ID3 algorithm that addresses several limitations of its predecessor. It introduces gain ratio as the splitting criterion, handles continuous features, supports missing values, and includes pruning capabilities. C4.5 is one of the most widely used decision tree algorithms and has been the basis for many other tree-based methods.

## Algorithm Details

### Time Complexity
- Training: O(n * p * log(n)), where n is the number of samples and p is the number of features
- Prediction: O(log(n))

### Space Complexity
- O(n * p) for storing the tree structure

### Key Components

1. **Node Structure**
   - Feature name
   - Threshold value (for continuous features)
   - Dictionary of child nodes
   - Value (for leaf nodes)
   - Feature type indicator

2. **Splitting Criterion**
   - Gain Ratio (Information Gain / Split Information)
   - Handles both continuous and categorical features
   - Supports missing values

3. **Stopping Criteria**
   - Maximum tree depth
   - Minimum samples per split
   - Pure node (all samples belong to same class)
   - No more features to split on

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**
   - Start with the root node containing all training data
   - Set maximum depth and minimum samples per split
   - Specify feature types (continuous/categorical)

2. **Recursive Splitting**
   - For each node:
     - Calculate gain ratio for each feature
     - For continuous features, find optimal split point
     - Select feature with highest gain ratio
     - Create child nodes based on split
     - Recursively apply to child nodes
     - Stop when stopping criteria met

3. **Leaf Node Assignment**
   - Assign majority class to leaf nodes
   - Store prediction value

## Implementation Details

### Key Methods

1. **`_calculate_entropy(y)`**
   - Calculates entropy of target variable
   - Used for measuring information gain

2. **`_calculate_split_info(X, feature)`**
   - Computes split information for a feature
   - Used in gain ratio calculation

3. **`_calculate_gain_ratio(X, y, feature)`**
   - Computes gain ratio for a feature
   - Combines information gain and split information

4. **`_find_best_split_continuous(X, y, feature)`**
   - Finds optimal split point for continuous features
   - Evaluates all possible thresholds

5. **`_build_tree(X, y, features, depth)`**
   - Recursively constructs decision tree
   - Handles both continuous and categorical features
   - Implements stopping criteria

### Usage Example

```python
from c45 import C45

# Initialize model
c45 = C45(max_depth=5, min_samples_split=2)

# Define feature names and types
feature_names = ['age', 'income', 'education', 'marital_status']
feature_types = ['continuous', 'continuous', 'categorical', 'categorical']

# Train model
c45.fit(X_train, y_train, feature_names, feature_types)

# Make predictions
predictions = c45.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = c45.score(X_test, y_test)
```

## Advantages
