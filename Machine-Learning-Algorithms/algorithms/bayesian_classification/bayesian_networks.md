# Bayesian Networks Classification

## 1. Overview
Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). They are powerful tools for modeling complex relationships between variables and making predictions under uncertainty.

### Type of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Probabilistic Classification
- Graphical Models

### Key Characteristics
- Directed acyclic graph structure
- Conditional probability tables
- Probabilistic inference
- Uncertainty handling
- Causal relationships

### When to Use
