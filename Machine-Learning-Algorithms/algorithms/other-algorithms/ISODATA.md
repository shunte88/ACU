# ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique)

## Overview
ISODATA is an iterative clustering algorithm that combines features of k-means and hierarchical clustering. It can automatically determine the number of clusters and merge or split clusters based on various criteria.

## Key Features
- Automatic cluster number determination
- Cluster merging and splitting
- Iterative optimization
- Distance-based clustering
- Adaptive clustering

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialization:
   - Set initial parameters
   - Choose initial centroids
2. Assignment:
   - Assign points to clusters
   - Update centroids
3. Cluster Management:
   - Merge close clusters
   - Split large clusters
   - Remove small clusters
4. Iteration:
   - Repeat until convergence
   - Check stopping criteria

## Advantages
- Automatic cluster number
- Flexible clustering
- Handles outliers
- Adaptive to data
- Robust results

## Limitations
- Computationally intensive
- Parameter sensitive
- Memory intensive
- Complex implementation
- May be slow for large datasets

## Use Cases
- Image segmentation
- Pattern recognition
- Data mining
- Remote sensing
- Feature extraction

## Implementation Considerations
- Parameter selection
- Distance metrics
- Memory management
- Convergence criteria
- Cluster management rules
