# SLIQ (Supervised Learning In Quest)

## Overview
SLIQ is a decision tree algorithm designed for handling large datasets. It uses a pre-sorting technique to improve efficiency and can handle both categorical and continuous attributes.

## Key Features
- Pre-sorting technique for efficiency
- Handles large datasets
- Supports both categorical and continuous attributes
- Memory-efficient
- Breadth-first tree building

## Algorithm Steps
1. Pre-sorting:
   - Sort continuous attributes
   - Create attribute lists
2. Class List Creation:
   - Maintain class distribution
   - Track node assignments
3. Tree Building:
   - Breadth-first approach
   - Evaluate splits using gini index
   - Create child nodes
4. Pruning:
   - MDL-based pruning
   - Error-based pruning

## Advantages
- Efficient for large datasets
- Memory efficient
- Handles mixed attribute types
- Good scalability
- Effective pruning

## Limitations
- Requires sufficient memory
- Sensitive to parameter settings
- May be slower for small datasets
- Complex implementation
- Requires careful tuning

## Use Cases
- Large-scale classification
- Data mining
- Pattern recognition
- Decision support
- Business intelligence

## Implementation Considerations
- Memory management
- Pre-sorting strategy
- Split evaluation metric
- Pruning method
- Node splitting criteria
