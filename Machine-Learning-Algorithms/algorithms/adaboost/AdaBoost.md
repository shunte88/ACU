# AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

## 1. Overview
AdaBoost is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier. It works by iteratively training weak learners on weighted versions of the training data, where the weights are adjusted to focus on previously misclassified examples.

### Type of Learning

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

AdaBoost combines multiple weak classifiers $h_t(x)$ into a strong classifier $H(x)$ through weighted voting. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

#### Weight Initialization
For a dataset with $m$ samples, initialize weights:
$$
w_i^{(1)} = \frac{1}{m}, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m
$$

#### Iterative Training
For each iteration $t = 1, \ldots, T$:

1. Train weak learner $h_t(x)$ on weighted data
2. Calculate weighted error:
   $$
   \epsilon_t = \sum_{i=1}^m w_i^{(t)} \mathbb{I}(h_t(x_i) \neq y_i)
   $$
3. Compute learner weight:
   $$
   \alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1 - \epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\right)
   $$
4. Update sample weights:
   $$
   w_i^{(t+1)} = \frac{w_i^{(t)}}{Z_t} \exp(-\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i))
   $$
   where $Z_t$ is a normalization factor:
   $$
   Z_t = 2\sqrt{\epsilon_t(1-\epsilon_t)}
   $$

#### Final Prediction
The strong classifier combines all weak learners:
$$
H(x) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t h_t(x)\right)
$$

#### Theoretical Guarantees
The training error of the final classifier is bounded by:
$$
\text{error}(H) \leq \exp(-2\sum_{t=1}^T \gamma_t^2)
$$
where $\gamma_t = \frac{1}{2} - \epsilon_t$ is the edge of the weak learner.

### Training Process
1. Initialize sample weights
2. For each iteration:
   - Train weak learner
   - Calculate error
   - Update weights
   - Store learner and its weight
3. Combine all learners

### Key Parameters

- Early stopping criteria

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Training:**
  - For each iteration $t$:
    - Weak learner training: $O(m d)$
    - Weight updates: $O(m)$
  - Total training: $O(T m d)$
  where:
  - $T$ = number of iterations
  - $m$ = number of samples
  - $d$ = number of features

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(T d)$ per sample
  - $O(n T d)$ for $n$ samples

### Space Complexity
- **Training:**
  - Sample weights: $O(m)$
  - Weak learners: $O(T L)$
  where $L$ is the space required for one weak learner

- **Prediction:**
  - $O(T d)$ for storing the ensemble

### Computational Requirements
- Memory efficient for small weak learners
- Parallelizable weak learner training
- Sequential weight updates
- Benefits from feature scaling

### Scalability Analysis
- Training time scales linearly with:
  - Number of iterations
