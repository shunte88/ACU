# Eclat Algorithm

## 1. Overview
The Eclat (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) algorithm is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets using a vertical data format. It uses a depth-first search approach and is particularly efficient for dense datasets.

### Type of Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Association Rule Learning
- Pattern Mining

### Key Characteristics
- Vertical data format
- Depth-first search
- No candidate generation
- Memory efficient
- Fast for dense datasets

### When to Use
- Dense datasets
- Frequent pattern mining
- Association rule discovery
- Market basket analysis
- Pattern recognition

## 2. Historical Context
- Developed by Zaki in 2000
- Improvement over Apriori algorithm
- Uses vertical data format
- More efficient for dense datasets
- Still widely used in practice

## 3. Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Vertical Data Format
Each item is represented by a list of transaction IDs (TID-list) in which it appears:
$$
T(X) = \{t \in T \mid X \subseteq t\}
$$
where:
- $T$ is the set of all transactions
- $X$ is an itemset
- $T(X)$ is the TID-list for $X$

#### Support
The support of an itemset $X$ is:
$$
\text{support}(X) = \frac{|T(X)|}{|T|}
$$
where $|T(X)|$ is the number of transactions containing $X$.

#### Intersection for Pattern Growth
To find the support of a candidate itemset $X \cup Y$:
$$
T(X \cup Y) = T(X) \cap T(Y)
$$

#### Association Rule Metrics
- **Confidence:**
$$
\text{confidence}(X \rightarrow Y) = \frac{\text{support}(X \cup Y)}{\text{support}(X)}
$$
- **Lift:**
$$
\text{lift}(X \rightarrow Y) = \frac{\text{confidence}(X \rightarrow Y)}{\text{support}(Y)} = \frac{\text{support}(X \cup Y)}{\text{support}(X) \times \text{support}(Y)}
$$

### Training Process
1. Convert horizontal format to vertical (TID-lists)
2. Find frequent 1-itemsets
3. Recursively intersect TID-lists to find frequent k-itemsets
4. Generate association rules
5. Filter rules by confidence

### Key Parameters
- Minimum support threshold
- Minimum confidence threshold
- Minimum lift threshold
- Maximum itemset size

## 4. Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
1. **Vertical Format Conversion:**
$$
O(n \times m)
$$
where:
- $n$ = number of transactions
- $m$ = number of items

2. **Pattern Mining (Depth-First Search):**
Let $k$ be the number of frequent patterns and $l$ the average pattern length:
$$
O(k \times l)
$$

3. **Rule Generation:**
$$
O(k \times 2^l)
$$

**Overall Complexity:**
$$
O(n \times m + k \times l + k \times 2^l)
$$

### Space Complexity
1. **TID-List Storage:**
$$
O(m \times n)
$$
where $m$ is the number of items and $n$ is the number of transactions.

2. **Pattern Storage:**
$$
O(k \times l)
$$

3. **Rule Storage:**
$$
O(r \times l)
$$
where $r$ is the number of rules.
