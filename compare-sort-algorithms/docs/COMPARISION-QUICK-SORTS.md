# Quick Sort Performance Comparison

**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Test Environment:** macOS  
**Data Size:** 100,000 random integers  

## Executive Summary

This performance comparison tests Quick Sort implementations across four popular programming languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++. All implementations used the same dataset of 100,000 randomly generated integers to ensure fair comparison.

## Performance Results

### Execution Times

| Language   | Execution Time (seconds) | Elements/Second | Relative Speed |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Java**   | 0.008590                | 11,641,670      | 1.00x (fastest) |
| **JavaScript** | 0.015543            | 6,433,696       | 1.81x slower   |
| **Python** | 0.111370                | 897,907         | 12.97x slower  |
| **C++**    | 0.691548                | 144,603         | 80.51x slower  |

### Performance Analysis

1. **ðŸ¥‡ Java (Winner)** - 0.008590 seconds
   - Fastest implementation with over 11.6 million elements processed per second
   - Benefits from JVM optimizations and mature just-in-time compilation
   - Excellent performance for large-scale sorting operations

2. **ðŸ¥ˆ JavaScript** - 0.015543 seconds  
   - Second fastest, processing over 6.4 million elements per second
   - Modern V8 engine optimizations make JavaScript surprisingly competitive
   - Only 1.81x slower than Java

3. **ðŸ¥‰ Python** - 0.111370 seconds
   - Respectable performance at nearly 900,000 elements per second
   - 12.97x slower than Java but still reasonable for most applications
   - Interpreted nature impacts performance compared to compiled languages

4. **C++** - 0.691548 seconds
   - Unexpectedly slowest at only 144,603 elements per second
   - 80.51x slower than Java - likely due to implementation differences
   - May benefit from algorithm optimization or different compiler flags
