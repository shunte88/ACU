# Sorting Algorithm Performance Summary (June 2025)

## Overview

This document provides an updated summary of the performance testing conducted on various sorting algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages. Testing was performed on datasets of different sizes to understand scaling characteristics and comparative performance.

## Test Environment

- **Date:** June 1, 2025
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Dataset Sizes Tested:** 
  - Small (N=10)
  - Medium (N=100,000)
  - Large (N=250,000)
  - Extra-Large (N=500,000)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, C
- **Algorithms Tested:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort

## Key Findings

### Algorithm Performance by Complexity Class

#### O(nÂ²) Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort:** These algorithms were only tested with the smallest dataset (N=10) due to their quadratic time complexity which makes them impractical for large datasets.
- For very small datasets, these algorithms showed comparable performance to more complex algorithms due to their low overhead.

#### O(n log n) Algorithms
- **Quick Sort:** Consistently showed excellent performance across all languages, particularly in Go and C implementations.
- **Merge Sort:** Generally performed well but was typically slower than Quick Sort except in certain cases (notably in C++ implementation).

#### O(n) Algorithms 
- **Counting Sort:** Demonstrated the best overall performance for large datasets, especially in compiled languages like C and C++.
- **Radix Sort:** Showed excellent performance similar to Counting Sort, with C and C++ implementations being particularly efficient.

### Language Performance Rankings (Based on 100K-500K datasets)

1. **C**: Consistently showed the best performance, particularly for linear complexity algorithms.
2. **C++**: Very close to C performance, with excellent results for Merge, Counting, and Radix sorts.
3. **Go**: Excellent performance across all algorithms, with standout results for Quick Sort.
4. **Java**: Strong JIT-optimized performance, especially for Quick Sort and Counting Sort.
5. **JavaScript**: Surprisingly competitive for a dynamic language, especially for Counting Sort.
6. **Python**: Consistently the slowest across most algorithms due to interpreter overhead, although still practical for moderate-sized datasets.

### Scaling Observations

- **Linear Scaling:** Counting Sort and Radix Sort demonstrated nearly linear scaling from 100K to 500K elements.
- **O(n log n) Scaling:** Quick Sort and Merge Sort showed the expected n log n scaling pattern.
- **Language Efficiency at Scale:** Lower-level languages maintained better scaling characteristics as data size increased.

## Practical Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommended Algorithm | Recommended Language | Reasoning |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Small datasets (<100 elements) | Insertion Sort | Any | Low overhead for small/nearly-sorted data |
| General purpose (< 1M elements) | Quick Sort | Go/C/C++ | Excellent average performance |
| Memory-constrained environments | Merge Sort | C/C++ | Predictable space complexity |
| Known value range | Counting Sort | C | Best performance when range is bounded |
| Integer data | Radix Sort | C/C++ | Excellent for integer datasets |
| Scripting/Development | Quick Sort | Python/JavaScript | Balance of performance and ease of implementation |

## Conclusion

The performance characteristics observed in this study align with theoretical expectations for algorithm complexity. For most general-purpose sorting needs, Quick Sort implemented in a compiled language offers the best balance of performance and flexibility. For specialized scenarios where the constraints of linear algorithms can be accommodated, Counting Sort and Radix Sort provide superior performance.

The latest tests confirm previous findings while showing continued performance improvements in language implementations, particularly for JavaScript engines which continue to close the gap with compiled languages.
