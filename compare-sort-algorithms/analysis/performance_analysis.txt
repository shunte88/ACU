3. PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS
-------------------------
• Fastest: C++ (0.006672 seconds)
• Slowest: Python (0.111784 seconds)
• Speed difference: 16.75x
• Average time: 0.035663 seconds
• Standard deviation: 0.050894 seconds

4. LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
--------------------------------

Python:
  Interpreted language with dynamic typing. Generally slower but highly readable and maintainable.
  Throughput: 894,586 elements/second

C++:
  Compiled language with manual memory management. Typically fastest due to low-level optimizations.
  Throughput: 14,988,010 elements/second

Java:
  Compiled to bytecode, runs on JVM. Good performance with automatic memory management.
  Throughput: 11,669,803 elements/second

JavaScript:
  Interpreted/JIT compiled. Performance varies by engine (V8 is highly optimized).
  Throughput: 6,399,590 elements/second

5. FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE
-----------------------------------
• Compilation vs Interpretation:
  - C++: Compiled to native machine code (fastest)
  - Java: Compiled to bytecode, JIT compilation
  - JavaScript: JIT compilation with V8 engine
  - Python: Interpreted (slowest)

• Memory Management:
  - C++: Manual memory management (most efficient)
  - Java/JavaScript: Garbage collection overhead
  - Python: Reference counting + garbage collection

• Optimization:
  - C++: Aggressive compiler optimizations (-O2)
  - Java: JVM runtime optimizations
  - JavaScript: V8 engine optimizations
  - Python: Limited optimization opportunities

6. CONCLUSIONS
---------------
• C++ is expected to be the fastest due to:
  - Native compilation and aggressive optimization
  - Manual memory management
  - No runtime overhead

• Java performance should be competitive due to:
  - JIT compilation optimizations
  - Mature JVM technology

• JavaScript may surprise with good performance due to:
  - V8 engine's advanced optimizations
  - JIT compilation

• Python is expected to be slowest due to:
  - Interpreted nature
  - Dynamic typing overhead
  - GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limitations

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
• For performance-critical applications: Use C++
• For balanced performance and productivity: Use Java
• For web applications: JavaScript (Node.js) is viable
• For rapid prototyping and development: Python

• Future improvements:
  - Test with different input patterns (sorted, reverse-sorted)
  - Compare with built-in sorting algorithms
  - Test with different data sizes
  - Profile memory usage
  - Test parallel/multi-threaded implementations
