# List of Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository provides a hands-on introduction to fundamental algorithms using the Python programming language. Each chapter covers a key topic in algorithms, with clear explanations and practical code examples. The goal is to help you understand how algorithms work and how to implement them in Python, making it easier to learn both programming and algorithmic thinking.

Each chapter folder contains:
- Python (.py) files with the algorithm implementations
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for interactive learning
- Markdown (.md) files that provide detailed explanations of the code and concepts

## How to Run the Code
To get started, see the [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) file for step-by-step instructions on how to clone the repository, set up Python, run the code, and experiment with the examples.

### Running with Jupyter Notebooks
This repository includes both Python (.py) files and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) versions of all code examples. You can run the notebooks:
- **Locally**: Using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab after installing the required dependencies
- **Online**: Using Google Colab (recommended) - simply open the notebooks directly from GitHub

For detailed instructions on running notebooks, please refer to the [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) file.

## Who Should Learn from This Repository?

This repository is designed for:
- People new to programming or Python
- Anyone interested in learning algorithms from scratch
- High-school and undergraduate students
- Graduate students who want a refresher on basic algorithms
- Self-learners and coding enthusiasts
