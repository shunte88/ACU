# HOWTO: Using the Algorithms-in-Python Repository

This guide will help you get started with the Algorithms-in-Python repository. Follow these steps to explore, run, and experiment with the code examples.

## 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

```zsh
git clone <repository-url>
cd Algorithms-in-Python
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

## 2. Set Up Python
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version with:

```zsh
python3 --version
```
If you need to install Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install python
```

## 3. Run the Code
Navigate to the chapter folder and run any Python file. For example:

```zsh
cd Chapter01-Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Language
python3 chapter01-basic-python.py
```

## 4. See the Results
The output will appear in your terminal. Follow any on-screen prompts for input if required.

## 5. Change the Code and Experiment
Open any `.py` file in your favorite code editor (such as VS Code). Modify the code, save your changes, and run the file again to see how your changes affect the results.
