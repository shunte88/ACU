# HOWTO: Using the Algorithms-in-Python Repository

This guide will help you get started with the Algorithms-in-Python repository. Follow these steps to explore, run, and experiment with the code examples.

## 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/vuhung16au/ACU.git
cd ACU/Algorithms-in-Python
```

## 2. Set Up Python
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version with:

```zsh
python3 --version
```
If you need to install Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install python
```

## 3. Run the Code
Navigate to the chapter folder and run any Python file. For example:

```zsh
cd Chapter01-Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Language
python3 chapter01-basic-python.py
```

## 4. See the Results
The output will appear in your terminal. Follow any on-screen prompts for input if required.

## 5. Change the Code and Experiment
Open any `.py` file in your favorite code editor (such as VS Code). Modify the code, save your changes, and run the file again to see how your changes affect the results.

## 6. Convert .py to Jupyter Notebooks 

- install a virtual environtment named `.venv`
- .venv/bin/python -m pip install p2j
- p2j filename.py

## 7. Using Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab

The repository already contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) versions of all Python files. You can easily run these in Google Colab:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on "File" > "Open notebook"
3. Select the "GitHub" tab
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/vuhung16au/ACU`
5. Navigate to the Algorithms-in-Python directory and select the notebook (.ipynb file) you want to open
6. The notebook will open in Colab and you can run the cells directly in your browser

This is a convenient way to experiment with the algorithms without installing anything on your local machine.
